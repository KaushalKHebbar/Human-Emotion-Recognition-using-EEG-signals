# Motivation

It’s through emotions that people are able to communicate and share their feelings effectively with one another. In today’s world many people suffer from mental illness like depression, anxiety and other disorders. They often keep these feelings to themselves which in the future may lead to other catastrophic results. Hence, emotion recognition serves as an important tool to estimate one’s mental health and thus, there is a need for an effective emotion recognition system that does this job. Several methods fail to identify emotions that are faked by the subject. The main objective of this project is to analyze EEG (Electroencephalogram) signals and to classify simple human emotions like happy and sad. Thus, this method proves to be the best possible approach for human emotion recognition system.
